# Voxity on Electron
This is a basic Electron wrapper for [Voxity](https://github.com/exerinity/voxity), a music player PWA

## Why?
No reason. I do not recommend using this, at least yet. This could potentially set up Voxity for desktop-specific features in the future, ~~one of which including Discord RPC, but for now, this is just a basic Electron wrapper.~~

This was incepted because I was trying to get Voxity to work with [Music Presence for Discord](https://musicpresence.app), which upon troubleshooting, I found out that it does not support PWAs, only native apps. So, I made this Electron wrapper to make Voxity appear as a native app to Music Presence. And turns out, it got detected. [Here is the issue I created about this](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/609).

In summary, this is just a small experiment and I recommend using [the web app](https://voxity.exerinity.com/i/how_pwa).

### **Voxity on Electron is now supported by Music Presence. If you want Discord RPC with Voxity, download this.** (and MP ofc)
